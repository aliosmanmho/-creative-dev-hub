# What Does Your IDE Theme Say About You?

Dark mode or light mode? Monokai or Dracula? Maybe even Solarized?  
Let’s be honest — our IDE theme is more than just colors, it’s a statement.

## 🎨 Common Developer Theme Archetypes

- **Monokai Fans:** You write fast, think fast, and probably live in the terminal.
- **Dracula Lovers:** You’re organized, a bit dramatic, and secretly love dark academia.
- **Solarized Light Users:** You value minimalism and hate low contrast.
- **Default Light Users:** You are brave. Or maybe your monitor brightness is low.

## 🔍 What’s Mine?

I use One Dark Pro — it’s soothing, modern, and helps me focus. But I admit, I switch every few months.

## 💬 What About You?

- What theme do you use and why?
- Have you ever judged someone’s code by their theme?
- Share a screenshot of your setup (if you’re brave enough 😄)
