# REST vs GraphQL

A structured comparison of RESTful APIs and GraphQL — their principles, strengths, trade-offs, and use cases.

---

## 🧱 What is REST?

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications based on standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

### ✅ Pros
- Easy to understand and implement
- Caching and status codes are well-defined
- Works well with browser clients

### ❌ Cons
- Over-fetching or under-fetching data
- Multiple endpoints needed
- Rigid response structure

---

## 🔗 What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs developed by Facebook, allowing clients to request only the data they need via a single endpoint.

### ✅ Pros
- Precise and flexible queries
- Reduces over-fetching
- Better for modern SPAs and mobile apps

### ❌ Cons
- Complexity in caching and performance
- Overhead on server side (resolvers)
- Learning curve for teams

## 📊 Common Use Cases

| Scenario                                      | Recommended API |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Simple CRUD operations                       | REST            |
| Public APIs with well-defined resources      | REST            |
| Mobile or frontend-heavy applications        | GraphQL         |
| Highly relational and nested data            | GraphQL         |
| Rapidly evolving requirements                | GraphQL         |
| Strong caching needs                         | REST            |
