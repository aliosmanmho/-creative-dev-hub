# How My Mentor Changed My Career Direction

Early in my career, I was stuck between frontend and backend development. I enjoyed both, but couldn't find clarity. Then I met a senior developer at my internship who became my mentor — and changed everything.

---

## 🎯 What They Did

- Asked the right questions instead of giving answers
- Encouraged me to experiment and fail
- Introduced me to clean architecture and systems thinking
- Gave me confidence to say “I don’t know” and learn publicly

---

## 🌱 The Result

I shifted from being a scattered generalist to someone who builds maintainable systems with intention. I still explore both frontend and backend, but now I have a design mindset.

---

## 🤝 Takeaway

Mentorship isn't about knowing all the answers — it's about helping someone uncover the right questions. I’m now mentoring others, passing it on.
