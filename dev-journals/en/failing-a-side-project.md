# What I Learned From Failing a Side Project

Like many developers, I started a side project with excitement — a productivity app I believed would change how teams work. After 6 months, it was abandoned. Here's what I learned from the failure.

---

## 💡 Mistakes I Made

- I focused too much on features, not user needs
- Never validated the idea with real users
- Spent too much time perfecting instead of shipping
- Worked alone, with no feedback loop

---

## 🎯 What I Gained

- Learned about product validation the hard way
- Realized the importance of MVP and early feedback
- Improved my planning, design, and focus
- It opened doors to collaborate with others

## 🔄 Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. Failure is not the end — it's part of the developer journey. I now have a better mindset for starting again.
